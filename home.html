        BUBBLE SORT
      </h1>  

      <p class="st">Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high.

        Bubble Sort Algorithm
        In Bubble Sort algorithm, 
        
        traverse from left and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
        In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
        This process is then continued to find the second largest and place it and so on until the data is sorted.</p>

        <h3>Advantages of Bubble Sort:</h3>

        <ul>
                <li>Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement.</li>
                <li>It does not require any additional memory space.</li>
                <li>It is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that elements with the same key value maintain their relative order in the sorted output.</li>
        </ul>
